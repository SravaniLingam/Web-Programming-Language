Create your personal homepage
The web page should contain legitimate information about you (background information, hobbies, interests etc.) and should not contain any HTML code that is generated by a web design tool (FrontPage, PageMaker, and etc.)
1. In your page’s HTML, make sure to include following elements:
	<img> : On your home page put your profile picture and float it to the left. (in the middle part where you see Welcome heading)
	<meta> for description of your web page
	<meta> for the keywords associated with your page
	favorites icon ("favicon")

2.In the header section, you will have menu items Home, About, Projects and Contact.

 
3. For style of your page, use an external css file (filename: index.css) and define your style sheet rules within that file.
4. Links on the top menu should take the user to the corresponding section within the same page. Links on the left can be to external websites.
5. You can have any content on the right panel.

NOTES:
1. If you like, your page can be laid out using Bootstrap grid structure (DIV tags). Otherwise you will use HTML/HTML5 and regular CSS for creating the page layout. You can use Bootstrap framework for other style properties as well. 
2. You can use colors of your choice for your home page.  For different color schemes, check following link: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_schemes.asp
3. Your page will not be tested on Microsoft Internet Explorer or other browsers that do not comply with the web standards. It will be only tested on latest versions of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
4. For full credit, your pages must pass the W3C HTML validator with no errors (a green bar). Choose appropriate HTML tags to match the structure of the content on the page. Do not express style information in HTML with inline styles or presentational HTML tags such as b or font.
Use following site for validation of your pages:
http://validator.w3.org/ (for HTML)
